# Ultimate Mail Mod

Version **7.0.1-ck5** · Kit release **0.11.77** · [All addons / hub](../README.md)

**A better mail window with mass send that no longer gets stuck after about 60 mails.**

Ultimate Mail Mod 7.0.1 ("continued"), updated for Cherry's Kit with a rewritten send queue.

## Features

From the original:

- **Inbox**: up to 18 mails in a list, sender names colour-coded, read/unread icons, the mail shown on the right, total gold of all visible mails, automatic opening and taking of attachments (items, gold or all), mass return and mass delete.
- **Composer**: pick recipients from Characters, Friends and Guildies; automatic subject when you only send money. Remembers all the characters you play on this computer.
- **Mass send items**: your whole backpack (all 6 tabs), click slots to mark them, or tag whole categories (runes, herbs, wood ...) with one click; send right away or with C.O.D. values per slot.

New in the Cherry's Kit version:

- **Mass send fixed**: the old version could send the next mail before the item was attached, counted failed mails as sent, and never gave a stuck item back, so it broke after about 60 mails until you logged out. Now each mail waits until its item is really attached, timeouts give the item back, and failures are retried (3 times by default, with growing waits).
- **Send fast or Send safely**: under 40 mails there is one Send button (fast). From 40 mails you choose: *Send fast* (quick pace, stops at the first failure) or *Send safely* (paced, with a short pause every 20 mails). C.O.D. mails always go the safe way. A **Stop** button stops after the current mail; unsent items stay marked.
- **Bound items in red**, also when several are marked; they are skipped with "(N bound, not sent)".
- **Ctrl+click** a marked item to unmark its whole group.
- **Settings window**: send delay, fast delay, batch size and pause, retries, slot check, new-mail sound, live trace, plus Run check, Show trace, Defaults and Forget own chars. Hover tooltips on everything.
- Faster bag handling (the bag list is no longer rebuilt on every bag change) and a faster loading screen.

**Please help test:** after a big mass send, `/umm trace` shows what happened. If sending waits forever, run `/umm x` with an item in the send slot and send the output; `/umm slotcheck off` is the workaround.
